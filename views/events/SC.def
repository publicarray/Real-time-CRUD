                            <h2>Sword Combat Rules</h2>
                            <p>(The rules to sword combat are very similar to point sparring rules)</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>All bouts are 1 minute for all ages</li>
                                <li>First to 5 points or who ever is ahead when time permits, will be declare the winner.</li>
                                <li>Bouts can only commence when the Centre Referee calls start.</li>
                                <li>Bouts can only finish when the Centre Referee calls stop.</li>
                                <li>The Centre referee is the only one who can start or stop bouts and issue warnings</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h2>Scoring points</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Hit to the head scores two points</li>
                                <li>All other parts of the body score one point, except you cannot score to the fingers and up to the wrist area. (Note: From above the wrist area is classified as body part)</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Legal Scoring Techniques</h2>
                            <p>You must keep the sword lower than your eye level when swinging or attacking your opponent. Stabbing type swings can only be done to the stomach area only.</p>
                            <h2>Illegal Techniques</h2>
                            <p>You cannot swing the sword back past eye level, as this would be classed as a baseball swing.
                            In the event of two warnings this will lead to point over.
                            No talking back to the Referee or disputing his/her final call.
                            Control of the weapon at all times must be applied (no exception).</p>
                            <h2>Equipment Required</h2>
                            <p>Headgear, Mouth guard and Full Martial Arts Uniform must be worn (No Exceptions).</p>
                            <h2>Note</h2>
                            <p>Competitors must supply their own equipment for this event. Some promoters will supply equipment</p>
