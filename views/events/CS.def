                            <h2>Coaching</h2>
                            <p>Coaching is a luxury that most competitors do not have access to at all times. (Definition of a coach. A person who trains athletes for games, a contest etc. and or to give instruction or advise to in the capacity of a coach.) Therefore, it sometimes can become an unfair advantage over a competitor who does not have a coach. Rules are made and enforced so no one competitor has an advantage or disadvantage over another competitor. Once the competitors enter the ring, the rules make the contest as equal and as fair as possible for both competitors. Therefore, the following rules on coaching apply:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never, at any time, can coaches, friend/s, team member, etc.; enter the ring without the refereeâ€™s permission (only the officials, competitors and medical personnel are normally allowed in a ring)</li>
                                <li>No abusive, violent, unsportsmanlike or overzealous coaching allowed.</li>
                                <li>A coach cannot ask for a time out (only a competitor may ask for a time out).</li>
                                <li>A coach can never, at any time, interfere with the proper running of the ring or the decisions of the judges.
                                The referee issues penalties for any of the above coaching infractions.</li>
                            </ul>
