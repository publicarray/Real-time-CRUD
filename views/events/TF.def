                        <p>(Empty hand no music, weapons, props etc) Competitors in these divisions, if offered, must exhibit a routine that reflects the essence and traditional values of the division name in which they are competing. The routine does not have to be a classical “form” handed down over the years, but should not deviate too far in form and content from the styles classical form.</p>
                        <p>
                        Competitors exhibiting a routine that is too “free”, have gymnastics, or other non-martial art techniques in them or are comprised of elements from more than one style should enter the musical division. Otherwise the competitor risks disqualification or down grading<p>
