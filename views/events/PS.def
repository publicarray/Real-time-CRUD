                            <h2>Order of Competition</h2>
                            <p>Once the final call for competitors of a division has been made at ringside, the referee and his/her ring personnel will mark off the names of the competitors. The order of competition will be as per the computer-generated draw.</p>
                            <h2>Length of Match</h2>

Running time means that the clock continues to run during point calls, etc., unless the referee calls for a time out. During unusually long point calls, equipment adjustments, rule clarifications, etc., the referee shall stop the time. If at the end of running time the match is tied, the match will continue into sudden victory overtime period. The first competitor to score a point is declared the winner.</p>
                            <h2>Point Values &amp; Winner Determination</h2>

                            The winner is determined by:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The first competitor who earns five (5) points automatically wins</li>
                                <li>If no one scores five (5) points by the end of the time limit competitor who is ahead wins.</li>
                                <li>In the even of a draw, the two fighters will fight until the next clean point is awarded by the Centre referee</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Illegal Target Areas</h2>

                            <h2>Coaching</h2>
                            <p>Coaching is a luxury that most competitors do not have access to at all times. (Definition of a coach. A person who trains athletes for games, a contest etc. and or to give instruction or advise to in the capacity of a coach.) Therefore, it sometimes can become an unfair advantage over a competitor who does not have a coach. Rules are made and enforced so no one competitor has an advantage or disadvantage over another competitor. Once the competitors enter the ring, the rules make the contest as equal and as fair as possible for both competitors. Therefore, the following rules on coaching apply:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Never, at any time, can coaches, friend/s, team member, etc.; enter the ring without the referee’s permission (only the officials, competitors and medical personnel are normally allowed in a ring).</li>
                                <li>No abusive, violent, unsportsmanlike or overzealous coaching allowed.</li>
                                <li>A coach cannot ask for a time out (only a competitor may ask for a time out).</li>
                                <li>A coach can never, at any time, interfere with the proper running of the ring or the decisions of the judges.
                                The referee issues penalties for any of the above coaching infractions.</li>
                            </ul>
